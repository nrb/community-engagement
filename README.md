# Tanzu Community Engagement

The purpose of this repository is to publish the Tanzu Community Engagement
guidelines, community health measurements, and goals.

## Using the information in this repo

We use these documents during the planning phase of open sourcing a new
project, and during our community engagement health checks.

We hope these documents can be useful for the wider open source community,
as you start out new projects or want to improve already existing ones.

The flow of information goes:

1. [GUIDELINES](GUIDELINES.md), used for planning and implementation of 
documentation, processes, and communication platforms for our open source
projects.

1. [HEALTHCHECKS](HEALTHCHECKS.md), used twice yearly to see what community
engagement improvements should be made in the near future.

## Further reading

Within this repository we also keep the following:

- [Inclusive terminology](INCLUSIVE_TERMINOLOGY.md) details and a [Vale](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/about) implementation
- [Security policy template](SECURITY.md), to be modified and added to each project
- [A "shoutouter" program](shoutouter/README.md) to generate reports on contributions from non-VMware community members
